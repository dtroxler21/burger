# burger

### Overview
This Node application allows users to eat burgers that are stored in MySQL. They can also add burgers to the database to be eaten. The file structure follows the MVC design pattern and uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app. Handlebars are used to generate the HTML.


* Eat Da Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the top of the page -- where they can be devoured by clicking on the 'Devour' button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the second section of the page and the 'devoured' boolean to true.
